# Hello, people! :wave:

You can call me Thejesh :grimacing: given the fact of how scary the last name is to pronounce!

I work as a _Software Development Engineer at_ [_Wint Wealth_](https://www.wintwealth.com/), an amazing startup based out of Bangalore. 
I always have been an inquisitive person where I believe in learning things while experimenting with them. 

A little more about me...
```javascript
const thejesh = {
  native: "Hyderabad, India",
  code: ['Java', 'Kotlin', 'Python', 'Javascript', 'HTML', 'CSS', 'SQL'],
  frameworks: ['Spring Boot', 'Django', 'React JS'],
  madAbout: "Badminton",
  isABigFoodie: true,
  favouriteQuote: "Better an oops than a what if!",
  awesomeness: undefined
}
```
